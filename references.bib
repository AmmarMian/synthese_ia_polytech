  abstract = {Abstract Climate change is profoundly affecting nearly all aspects
              of life on earth, including human societies, economies, and health.
              Various human activities are responsible for significant greenhouse
              gas (GHG) emissions, including data centers and other sources of
              large‐scale computation. Although many important scientific
              milestones are achieved thanks to the development of
              high‐performance computing, the resultant environmental impact is
              underappreciated. In this work, a methodological framework to
              estimate the carbon footprint of any computational task in a
              standardized and reliable way is presented and metrics to
              contextualize GHG emissions are defined. A freely available online
              tool, Green Algorithms ( www.green‐algorithms.org ) is developed,
              which enables a user to estimate and report the carbon footprint of
              their computation. The tool easily integrates with computational
              processes as it requires minimal information and does not interfere
              with existing code, while also accounting for a broad range of
              hardware configurations. Finally, the GHG emissions of algorithms
              used for particle physics simulations, weather forecasts, and
              natural language processing are quantified. Taken together, this
              study develops a simple generalizable framework and freely
              available tool to quantify the carbon footprint of nearly any
              computation. Combined with recommendations to minimize unnecessary
              CO 2 emissions, the authors hope to raise awareness and facilitate
              greener computation.},

  abstract = {An accurate energy consumption prediction becomes crucial with
              increasing electric vehicle usage for effective power grid
              management. This research examined the performance of eleven
              machine learning models for this purpose: Ridge Regression, Lasso
              Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector
              Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM,
              Gaussian Processes for Regression(GPR) and Extra Trees Regressor,
              considering real historical data from Colorado. The models were
              evaluated using different metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean
              Squared Error (MSE), R², Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) and
              Normalized Root Mean Squared Error(NRMSE), with visual analyses
              through scatter plots and time series plots. The best model
              observed was the Extra Trees Regressor, which had an MAE of 0.5888,
              an MSE of 3.2683, R² value of 0.9592, RMSE of 1.8078 and NRMSE of
              0.020. Gradient Boosting and KNN also returned good results,
              although they were slightly more dispersed. Nevertheless, while
              non-linear models like MLP, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM and linear
              models such as Ridge and Lasso Regression offer valuable insights,
              they exhibit shortcomings in estimating energy, especially at
              extreme levels, highlighting limitations in capturing complex
              non-linear interactions. This study focuses on their applicability
              to energy projections to demonstrate how well ensemble and
              non-linear models may capture intricate patterns in time series.
              These cutting-edge machine learning techniques might greatly
              enhance energy demand predictions.},

  abstract = {A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of
              membership. Such a set is characterized by a membership
              (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of
              membership ranging between zero and one. The notions of inclusion,
              union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are
              extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in
              the context of fuzzy sets are established. In particular, a
              separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without
              requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint.},

abstract = {This paper presents Pol-InSAR-Island, the first publicly available multi-frequency Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-InSAR) dataset labeled with detailed land cover classes, which serves as a challenging benchmark dataset for land cover classification. In recent years, machine learning has become a powerful tool for remote sensing image analysis. While there are numerous large-scale benchmark datasets for training and evaluating machine learning models for the analysis of optical data, the availability of labeled SAR or, more specifically, Pol-InSAR data is very limited. The lack of labeled data for training, as well as for testing and comparing different approaches, hinders the rapid development of machine learning algorithms for Pol-InSAR image analysis. The Pol-InSAR-Island benchmark dataset presented in this paper aims to fill this gap. The dataset consists of Pol-InSAR data acquired in S- and L-band by DLR's airborne F-SAR system over the East Frisian island Baltrum. The interferometric image pairs are the result of a repeat-pass measurement with a time offset of several minutes. The image data are given as 6 × 6 coherency matrices in ground range on a 1 m × 1m grid. Pixel-accurate class labels, consisting of 12 different land cover classes, are generated in a semi-automatic process based on an existing biotope type map and visual interpretation of SAR and optical images. Fixed training and test subsets are defined to ensure the comparability of different approaches trained and tested prospectively on the Pol-InSAR-Island dataset. In addition to the dataset, results of supervised Wishart and Random Forest classifiers that achieve mean Intersection-over-Union scores between 24% and 67% are provided to serve as a baseline for future work. The dataset is provided via KITopenData: https://doi.org/10.35097/1700.}

abstract = {We present Interferometric Synthetic Aperture data spanning a series of precipitation events that impacted the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula in 2017-2018. The arid climate, sparse vegetation and low topographic relief result in very high interferometric coherence magnitude between most pairs of dates, even for those separated by multiple years. For pairs of dates with differing soil moisture conditions, such as a “dry” date and a date immediately following one of the precipitation events, the interferometric coherence magnitude is much lower. However, pairs spanning the same event, but with a longer time interval, have high interferometric coherence magnitude. This observation suggests that the phase changes that result in lower coherence for some pairs are not permanent, such as those that would result from erosion or deposition of material, but are due to the variations in soil moisture. In support of this view, when we compare the phase of individual pixels to their neighbors, we observe similar phase change trends for each precipitation event. We present a simple statistical model of the relationship between soil moisture and phase, and show that it predicts the observed coherence and phase histories within this particular SAR time series. We also show how the parameters of this relationship can be inferred from the InSAR observables, and can be used to reduce the soil moisture effects on coherence and phase even for pairs of dates that were not used in that parameter estimation. For the test data considered here, the noise associated with soil moisture is reduced by 40%. We present results for synthetic time series, including a demonstration of the widely-observed phenomenon that displacement rates inferred from InSAR time series depend on the choice of interferometric pairs used in the analysis.}
